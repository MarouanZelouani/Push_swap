for stack that contains more than 3 elements

1: push everything into b until there is only 3 elemt left in a then sort a 
using sort_three() function 
2: set up the target for every node in the stack b 
the target is the node in a wich is bigger than our selected node but also the smalles
in all the nodes that are bigger than our node
if this condition does not appl the target will be the smallest 

i need: min_node()
        set_target()
